First Project Of The Fundamentals Pathway at TOP.

Successfully completed all assignments.
Git is difficult to handle, however, I think that in due time, I will be able to master it, which is intended!

It took me +2hours to finish this project, mostly because I challenged myself to not look anywhere how to proceed.

I managed to complete my assignments successfully, so I am really proud of this Recipes Project!
